1) Javascript is used to make the website interactive and dynamic.

2) We use var, let, const to define datatypes. var and let seems to be same but they are limited to their block scope. 

3) types of datatypes

Undefined
Number
String
boolean

4) We can only do override var with var, let with let, & const with const . 

5) The main difference in let and const is let is limited to their scope wheres const is not. [study it more yourself.]

5) Undefined and null are not the same thing. 

6) Null is considered as a Object.

7) ' === ' means comparison. basically true or false. We can also the like this > or <.

const hey = 60;
const bye = 30;

/** === */

hey === bye // answer will be false

/*** > or < ***/

hey<=bye // answer will be false
hey>=bye // answer will be true

8) You can add string like 'abc '  with number like '60'. so result would be 'abc60'

9) We always add javascript in the last of the body because javascript takes a lot of time to load. // important

10) We can us defer keyword if we wish to add the javascript in the top not in the body.
